# python-tools
# 1. please run the run.py file in the current directory of this file to crawl the tensorflow, keras and pytorch api document.
# 2. please install the node with version 7.x, 8.x or 10.x. The reason is that we use node in the command line to generate the index.json file, so if you do not install node, you just cannot get the index.json, but the other file such as html tree directory, markdown tree directory and tar.gz file also can be gotten successfully.
